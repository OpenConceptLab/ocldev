It allows us to track the response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas and among specific populations as well as at the national level.,"This indicator should be collected from facility ART registers/databases, program monitoring tools, and drug supply management systems.

Count the number of adults and children who are currently receiving ART in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards) at the end of the reporting period.
* Patients on ART who initiated or transferred-in during the reporting period should be counted.
* Patients that pick up several months of antiretroviral drugs at one visit should also be counted as long as they have received enough ARVs to last to the end of the reporting period.
* However, if it is determined that a patient has died, they should immediately be removed from the TX_CURR results.
* HIV-positive pregnant women who are eligible for and are receiving antiretroviral drugs for their own treatment are included. HIV-positive pregnant women initiating lifelong ART through PMTCT (Option B+) will count as “current” on ART under this indicator. These include HIV-infected pregnant women who:
  * Have newly initiated ART during the current pregnancy
  * Are already on ART at the beginning of the current pregnancy

Patients excluded from the current on ART count are patients who died, stopped treatment, transferred out, or are lost to follow-up. Patients who have not received ARVs within four weeks of their last missed drug pick-up should not be counted. Patients do not need to qualify as lost to follow-up before tracing efforts commence. Efforts to trace patients that have missed a clinical visit or drug pick-up should begin immediately following a missed clinical contact. TX_ML describes the PEPFAR-recommended patient tracing process in more detail.

This indicator should be reported from both PEPFAR-supported sites in the private or public sector. Patients currently receiving treatment from mobile clinics can be reported in two ways. Firstly, if the mobile clinic is associated (receives commodities, reports to, is staff by) a nearby health facility, then these individuals should be reported by that facility. Secondly, if a mobile clinic is stationary for more than 2 reporting periods, it should be added to the PEPFAR facility list with geocodes and data should be reported for this mobile clinic directly.

DO NOT include: Patients who receive ARVs for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or short-term ART only for prevention (PrEP) should not be reported in this indicator.","* Confirm that TX_CURR ≥ TX_NEW

For example, a 14-year-old child will be counted as currently receiving treatment in the <15 age category at the end of reporting period “A”.

* Pregnancy disaggregation removed due to confusion with this disaggregation and PMTCT_ART. However, the breastfeeding disaggregate was retained.",Facility,Quarterly,"The indicator measures the ongoing scale-up and uptake of ART programs. This measure is critical to monitor along with number of patients currently on ART in relation to the number of PLHIV that are estimated to be eligible for treatment to assess progress in the program’s response to the epidemic in specific geographic areas and populations as well as at the national level. This is particularly critical in the context of current revisions to country-specific ART eligibility.

Reporting the number of new patients enrolled on ART at both the national and overall PEPFAR program levels is critical to monitoring the HIV services cascade, specifically the successful linkage between HIV diagnosis and initiating ART. Disaggregation of new on ART by age/sex at ART initiation, pregnancy status at ART initiation, and breastfeeding status at ART initiation is important to understand the percentage of new ART initiations coming from priority populations.","Facility ART registers/databases, program monitoring tools, or drug supply management systems.
* The numerator can be generated by counting the number of adults and children who are newly enrolled in ART in the reporting period, in accordance with the nationally approved treatment protocol (or WHO/UNAIDS standards).
* Patients who known to transfer in from another facility, or who temporarily stopped therapy and have started again should not be counted as new patients.
* NEW is a state defined by an individual initiating ART during the reporting period. It is expected that the characteristics of new clients are recorded at the time they newly initiate life-long ART. For example, patients who receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), short term ART only for prevention (PrEP), or ART starter pack alone should not be used to count individuals reached with this indicator. 

BF disaggregation: Women who initiate ART while breastfeeding should be counted under this indicator but not in PMTCT_ART.

Key population disaggregation* see Appendix A to support the identification of key populations at ART initiation. However, reporting of key population disaggregation should be consistent with what is described under the KP_PREV “How to review for data quality” section on mutual exclusivity of an individual who falls under multiple KP categories (e.g., FSW who injects drugs). In such instances, the individual should only be reported in ONE KP disaggregation category with which s/he is most identified in order to avoid double-counting.

NOTE: both KP-specific and clinical partners have the option to complete these disaggs, but only if safe to maintain these files and to report.","* Numerator ≥ subtotal of each disaggregation: The total number of adults and children newly enrolled on ART should be greater or equal to the sum of all of the age/sex disaggregations and pregnancy/ breastfeeding status.

The reporting period still covers a 12-month period and may include data from the previous fiscal year.

Data source hierarchy for indicator reporting is established.

Guiding narrative questions updated.",Facility,Quarterly,"VL SUPPRESION OUTCOMES:
This indicator monitors the proportion of documented viral load results from adult and pediatric ART patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months (or according to national guidelines) with a suppressed result (<1,000 copies/ml). This allows ART programs to monitor individual and overall programmatic response to ART as measured by virologic suppression. This indicator will provide data on patients who have a viral load (VL) test in the past 12 months and the percentage who were virally suppressed at the most recent test.

VL TESTING COVERAGE:
Comparison of the denominator for this indicator with the result for TX_CURR from 6 months earlier (i.e., two quarters prior) can be used to crudely estimate VL testing coverage supported by PEPFAR. For example, a comparison may be made between the FY19 Q1 denominator for TX_PVLS and FY18 Q3 TX_CURR, given that patients newly initiating ART and included in TX_CURR in FY18 Q4 and FY19 Q1 may not be eligible for a viral load test. In calculating this estimate, it is important to ensure that individuals, not tests are being reported for TX_PVLS.

Analyzing both VL testing coverage and suppression rates by geography, sub-population, and implementing mechanisms is essential for program management and quality of care. Real-time review of VL results should trigger an immediate response to follow-up on patients who are not suppressed (i.e., VL ≥1000).","This indicator should be collected from clinical sources (e.g., electronic or paper patient records), where possible, to ensure de-duplicated patient counting and receipt of results to inform patient care. Ideally, data for this indicator should be collected from an electronic medical records system (EMR) to minimize data collection errors and ensure that results are informing patient care. If data collection from an EMR is not possible, indicator data may be collected from paper-based registers or reports that reflect the VL results. If standard patient registers do not contain all the required information, individual patient records should be reviewed.

If a clinical source does not exist or does not contain the desired information, data may be extracted from an electronic laboratory information system (LIS). VL results from an LIS must be linked to back to the individual patients and their record at sites.

NOTE: If patient-linked VL results from LIS is used for reporting, it is incumbent that the implementing partner ensure this information is transcribed into the patient record for timely VL results utilization/patient management.

The data source used for reporting on this indicator should be specified and data reported should be de-duplicated and used to inform patient care at sites. If the LIS is used, please explain why clinical sources could not be used to report on this indicator in the narrative (see guiding narrative question section below).

VL results should be reported for patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months (or according to national guidelines). It is important to ensure that the data sources used to collect and aggregate data are updated to be able to report VL results data for patients who have been on ART for at least 3 months.

The indicator reporting frequency is now quarterly. The reporting period still covers a 12- month period and may include data from the previous fiscal year (see visual below). For example, when reporting data in FY19 Q1, country teams will be required to report data for FY18 Q2+ FY18 Q3+FY18 Q4+ FY19 Q1.

Both only VL tests with recorded results and VL results that are linked back to patients should be included in the numerator and denominator of this indicator.

This indicator should be reported for all PEPFAR-supported treatment sites (i.e., from all reporting TX_CURR). VL monitoring result utilization should be promoted for individual patient, site, and program use. If a PEPFAR-supported treatment site (i.e., a site that has reported TX_CURR) has not collected any samples for VL testing, ""0"" should be entered for both the numerator and denominator.

Where more than one result is available for the reporting period, the most recent result should be reported. Programs should describe the method(s) of data collection and the results de-duplication methodology utilized in their narratives.","Denominator ≥ Numerator: The number of VL results from adults and children on ART must be greater than or equal to the number of VL results from adult and pediatric ART patients with a VL <1,000 copies/ml.
